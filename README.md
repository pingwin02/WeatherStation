# WeatherStation

## To start the app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker compose up --build` in the root directory
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/api/sensors` in your browser
4. Go to the GeneratorScript directory
5. Run `python3 -m venv venv`
6. Run `source venv/bin/activate`
7. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Run `python3 sensors_data_generator.py`
9. Refresh `http://localhost:8000/api/sensors` in your browser to see the results
10. To stop the app, run `docker compose down -v` in the root directory. It will remove the database volume as well.


## Endpoints:

### Sensors:

- GET `/api/sensors` - get a list of all sensors
- GET `/api/sensors/{id}` - get information about a specific sensor by its ID
- POST `/api/sensors` - create a new sensor
- PATCH `/api/sensors/{id}` - update a specific sensor by its ID
- DELETE `/api/sensors/{id}` - delete a specific sensor by its ID

### Data:

- GET `/api/data` - get all data
- GET `/api/sensors/{id}/data` - get all data for a specific sensor by its ID
- GET `/api/sensors/{id}/data/recent` - get the most recent data for a specific sensor by its ID

### Tokens:

- GET `/api/sensors/{id}/tokens` - get the token balance for a specific sensor by its ID

### Swagger:

- `/api/swagger` - Swagger documentation

# Blockchain Module Setup

## Metamask Configuration
1. **Set up Holesky testnet**  
   In Metamask, add the Holesky testnet by providing the necessary network details.

2. **Receive Test ETH**  
   Use a Holesky testnet faucet to receive test ETH, for example, from the [Ethereum Hole≈°ky Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky).

3. **Import Sensor Coins**  
   To view Sensor Coins balance, import the tokens into Metamask by providing the contract address.

## ERC-20 Smart Contract Deployment
1. **Program Smart Contract**  
   Use Solidity to program an ERC-20 smart contract.

2. **Compile and Deploy**  
   Use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile the smart contract and deploy it to the Holesky testnet.

## Blockchain Network Access
1. **Create Infura Account**  
   Sign up at Infura and create a project to get your API key for blockchain access.

## Monitoring
- Use the [Etherscan Holesky Explorer](https://holesky.etherscan.io) to monitor transactions related to your deployed contract.
